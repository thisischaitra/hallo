### How to run the code

This tutorial is an executable [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org) hosted on [Jovian](https://www.jovian.ai). You can _run_ this tutorial and experiment with the code examples in a couple of ways: *using free online resources* (recommended) or *on your computer*.

#### Option 1: Running using free online resources (1-click, recommended)

The easiest way to start executing the code is to click the **Run** button at the top of this page and select **Run on Colab**. [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) is a free online platform for running Jupyter notebooks using Google's cloud infrastructure. You can also select "Run on Binder" or "Run on Kaggle" if you face issues running the notebook on Google Colab. 


#### Option 2: Running on your computer locally

To run the code on your computer locally, you'll need to set up [Python](https://www.python.org), download the notebook and install the required libraries. We recommend using the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) distribution of Python. Click the **Run** button at the top of this page, select the **Run Locally** option, and follow the instructions.
